# Complementary files
This is a list of files you must add into the root of the project if you want to make this mod work. These files are not included in this repository because they are too large in MB data and are not needed to be changed via GitHub. They're not yet avaliable for download but they'll be released eventually, when this project is in an advanced stage of development.
