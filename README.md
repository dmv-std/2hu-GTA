Also known as Touhou Grand Theft Auto: III Era, is a modification that has as goal a full GTA-like storyline with Touhou characters as playable and protagonists of the game, based on the GTA San Andreas engine, with lot of fun missions and side missions, and even a RPG-like system to customize your characters.

# Is this project alive?

Yes, but unfortunately, i cannot advance at the step i would like to.

# When we will see this project finished

With luck, in 2054. Unless you support me of course :)

# How can i support?

1. Make donations! If i can earn money with this, i can dedicate my full time to this.
2. Are you programmer/modeller/can write funny stories and dialogs/have a lot of creativity/are you fan of touhou and know a lot about its characters and its background? You can join the project!

# Is there an available demo?

Yes, but it has barely 1% of all the stuff i would like to add. Besides, it still has several issues. But its playable!
First, get a copy of GTA San Andreas v1.0 HOODLUM (spanish option needed) and install it. Then go here:
https://onedrive.live.com/?id=B261D6229F6EC2A7%21215&cid=B261D6229F6EC2A7

Download common.zip, and extract content inside GTA SA folder (overwriting everything). Then download v0.1c.zip and again, extract content inside GTA SA folder (overwriting everything).

Alternatively you can get modloader:
http://www.gtagarage.com/mods/show.php?id=25377
And extract common.zip and v0.1c.zip inside GTASAfolder/modloader/2huGTA (read the modloader install instructions).

It is important that you set the language to spanish. You will see some dialogs in spanish and others in english. I hope to fix the language issue in a future.
