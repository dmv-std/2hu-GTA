# What is 2hu-GTA?

Also known as Touhou Grand Theft Auto: III Era, is a modification that has as goal a full GTA-like storyline with Touhou characters as playable and protagonists of the game, based on the GTA San Andreas engine, with lot of fun missions and side missions, and even a RPG-like system to customize your characters.

# Is this project alive?

Yes, but unfortunately, i cannot advance at the step i would like to.

# When we will see this project finished

With luck, in 2054. Unless you support me of course :)

# Update (11/04/2020)

There are another GTA projects that are requirements to continue on the developing on this:
* [Dear Imgui SA](https://github.com/lolipalooza/DearImguiSA): with this project, i'm trying to make functional a very advanced GUI on the GTASA engine. This is prerequisite to MissionDesigner for GTASA.
* [MissionDesigner](https://github.com/lolipalooza/MissionDesigner): this project has the goal to create an extremely advanced interface to create missions and activities on the GTASA without too much coding needing. This could potentially agilize the storyline creation process, converting the 2hu-GTA project in just a creative problem instead of technical.

I don't recommend you to wait for this soon. Sadly, i have zero time to this and all i can do for now is just leaving the ideas in the air.

# How can i support?

1. Make donations! If i can earn money with this, i can dedicate my full time to this.
2. Are you programmer/modeller/can write funny stories and dialogs/have a lot of creativity/are you fan of touhou and know a lot about its characters and its background? You can join the project!

# Is there an available demo?

Yes, but it has barely 1% of all the stuff i would like to add. Besides, it still has several issues. But it's playable!
First, get a copy of GTA San Andreas v1.0 HOODLUM (spanish option needed) and install it. Then go to Releases section:

Common Files: https://github.com/lolipalooza/2hu-GTA/releases/tag/v0.x-common

Most recent version (v0.1c): https://github.com/lolipalooza/2hu-GTA/releases/tag/v0.1c

Download common.zip, and extract content inside GTA SA folder (overwriting everything). Then download v0.1c.zip and again, extract content inside GTA SA folder (overwriting everything).

Alternatively you can get modloader, so you don't need to overwrite stuff:
http://www.gtagarage.com/mods/show.php?id=25377
And extract common.zip and v0.1c.zip inside GTASAfolder/modloader/2huGTA (read the modloader install instructions).

It is important that you set the language to spanish. You will see some dialogs in spanish and others in english. I hope to fix the language issue in a future.
